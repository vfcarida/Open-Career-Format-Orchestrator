/**
 * @module domain/types
 * @description Core type definitions for the Open Career Format (OCF) system.
 *
 * These types implement the OKF v0.1 specification adapted for career management.
 * The OKF spec requires only a `type` field in YAML frontmatter, but we define
 * career-specific types to provide structured, semantic classification of
 * professional data.
 *
 * ## Why these specific career types?
 *
 * The OKF specification intentionally leaves `type` values open — there is no
 * central registry. Our career-specific types were chosen to model the complete
 * lifecycle of a job seeker's professional identity:
 *
 * - **Skill** — The atomic unit of professional capability. Skills are the
 *   currency of ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and keyword matching.
 * - **Experience** — Work history entries that demonstrate applied skills
 *   in real-world contexts. Maps to resume "Experience" sections.
 * - **Education** — Academic credentials that validate foundational knowledge.
 * - **Certificate** — Industry certifications and licenses that provide
 *   third-party validation of expertise.
 * - **Project** — Notable projects that showcase practical application,
 *   especially valuable for portfolio-driven roles.
 * - **Preference** — Job search parameters (location, salary, remote policy)
 *   that enable intelligent job matching and filtering.
 * - **Application** — A record of a job application submission, enabling
 *   pipeline tracking (Kanban) and historical analysis.
 *
 * Each type maps to a distinct Markdown file within the OKF bundle, making
 * the entire career profile human-readable, version-controllable, and
 * interoperable with any LLM or agent that can read Markdown + YAML.
