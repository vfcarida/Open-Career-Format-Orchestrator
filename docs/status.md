# Maturity and Feature Status

AKCP uses strict, evidence-based maturity levels. We do not claim production readiness without executable evidence (tests, documentation, and working examples).

## Maturity Definitions

| Level | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Stable** | Documented, tested, CI-validated, examples exist, no known critical gaps. Ready for production. |
| **Beta** | Mostly working and tested, API may change, limitations are documented. Ready for non-critical environments. |
| **Alpha** | Implemented enough to inspect, incomplete tests or UX. Use for exploration only. |
| **Experimental** | Exploratory, not recommended for production or stable use. May be removed. |
| **Planned** | Not implemented; docs may describe intent only. |
| **Deprecated** | Supported temporarily with a migration path. Will be removed in a future major version. |
