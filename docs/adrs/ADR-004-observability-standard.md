# ADR-004: Observability and Telemetry Standard

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Diagnosing tool failures, filesystem parsing issues, and browser delays across decoupled MCP processes requires unified tracing.

## Decision
We deploy the **OpenTelemetry (OTel) Node.js SDK** in core and servers. Tracing spans are injected around:
- Core filesystem read/write/parse events.
- MCP tool calls latency.
- Playwright page interactions.
Custom counters track success/failures rates.

## Consequences
- Standardised JSON metrics output.
- Direct connectivity with standard collectors (Jaeger, Prometheus).
