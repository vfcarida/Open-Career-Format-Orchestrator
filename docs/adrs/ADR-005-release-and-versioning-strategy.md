# ADR-005: Release and Versioning Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As a multi-package monorepo under development, changes to the core format schema or protocol server tools can break compatibility with downstream client dashboards.

## Decision
We enforce:
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** across all workspace packages.
- **Conventional Commits** format validation in CI.
- Human-centric release summaries via **Keep a Changelog** standard.

## Consequences
- Transparent release cycles.
- Clear breaking change boundaries for schemas.
