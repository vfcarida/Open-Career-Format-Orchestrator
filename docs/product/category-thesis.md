# Agent Knowledge Compiler and Control Plane

_A thesis on the semantic compilation and runtime grounding of Agentic AI._

## The Problem: Structural Hallucination

The market is obsessed with Agentic AI—systems that reason, plan, and execute actions autonomously. However, even the most capable models fail when fed disorganized, unstructured, or overly permissive context. We call this **structural hallucination**.

Currently, the industry relies on two extremes:

1. **Probabilistic RAG:** Dumping massive amounts of unstructured PDFs into a vector database. Agents retrieve fragments that lack relationships, hierarchy, or strict data contracts.
2. **Raw RPC endpoints (MCP):** Exposing bare APIs to models. While powerful, exposing raw MCP tools without semantic boundaries, safety constraints, or budgetary limits invites catastrophic failures (OWASP LLM Top 10 risks like Excessive Agency and Prompt Injection).

## The Missing Link: Semantic Compilation

If software engineering requires compilers to transform human-readable code into machine-executable binaries, **Agent Engineering requires a semantic compiler to transform organizational knowledge into agent-consumable context.**

This compiler must ingest fragmented docs, APIs, and policies, validate them against rigid schemas (like OKF), and emit **Context Packs**—dense, strongly-typed bundles.

But a compiler is not enough. Once compiled, the context must be served and governed.

## The Solution: The Control Plane

The **Control Plane** is the runtime environment that governs agentic interaction. It sits between the agent (e.g., Cursor, a background worker) and the compiled knowledge.

The Control Plane provides:

- **Registry-Driven Discovery:** Agents ask the Control Plane what tools and resources they are allowed to use.
- **Context Budgeting:** The Control Plane truncates or summarizes data to preserve token windows and reduce costs.
- **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Authorizations:** Destructive actions are intercepted by the Control Plane and queued for human approval via an operator dashboard.
- **Observability:** Every read, write, and submit is immutably logged for auditability.

## Conclusion

Agent-Ready Knowledge is not just a format; it is a lifecycle. The **Agent Knowledge Compiler and Control Plane (AKCP)** is the standard infrastructure required to move agents from fragile prototypes into safe, governed enterprise production.
