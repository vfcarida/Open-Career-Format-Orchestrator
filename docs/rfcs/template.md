## 1. Problem Statement

Describe the problem you are trying to solve. Why is this an issue for AKCP users or autonomous agents? Focus on the _why_ before the _how_.

## 2. Proposal

Describe the proposed solution in detail. Provide code snippets, JSON schemas, or Markdown examples.

- If proposing a new MCP Tool, include the exact JSON Schema for its arguments.
- If proposing a new OKF Profile, include a sample Markdown file.

## 3. Alternatives Considered

What other approaches did you consider? Why were they rejected in favor of the proposal? (e.g., "We could have used pure RAG here, but it failed to guarantee X").

## 4. Compatibility Impact

Does this change break existing Context Packs, MCP clients, or agents?

- If yes, detail the exact nature of the breaking change.
- Refer to the [Compatibility Policy](../specs/compatibility.md).

## 5. Migration Path

If there is a breaking change, how will existing users migrate?
Provide the exact CLI commands or manual steps required (e.g., `akcp migrate --to v2`).

## 6. Test Plan

How will this feature be verified? Detail the specific Evals scenarios or unit tests that must pass before this RFC is considered implemented. (e.g., "We will run the `Tool Selection Ambiguity` eval to ensure the new capability description doesn't cause hallucination").
