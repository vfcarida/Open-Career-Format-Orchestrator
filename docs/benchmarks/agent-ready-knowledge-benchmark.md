# Agent-Ready Knowledge Benchmark

## Objective

To empirically demonstrate the value of structuring knowledge into strictly governed Context Packs over exposing raw, unstructured documents to LLMs. This benchmark provides quantitative metrics to justify the adoption of AKCP in enterprise environments.

## Methodology

The benchmark operates deterministically by running a suite of evaluations across 7 core enterprise and engineering tasks. Each scenario simulates an LLM's response trajectory, measuring baseline performance (raw repositories, OpenWiki docs, basic MCP tools) against the AKCP treatment (OKF context packs, budget compression, and the Capability Registry).

### Evaluated Metrics

- **Task Success Rate**: The probability of the agent successfully completing the end-to-end user goal.
- **Token Cost**: The total volume of tokens ingested by the model (directly correlated to USD cost).
- **Latency (ms)**: Time taken to serve the context and process the prompt.
- **Tool Selection Accuracy**: How accurately the LLM picks the correct capability based on metadata.
- **Hallucination Rate**: The frequency of the LLM inventing fields, policies, or risks.
- **Citation Accuracy**: How accurately the LLM attributes its facts to explicit files/provenance.
- **Unsafe Action Rate**: The frequency of executing destructive side-effects without Human-in-the-Loop authorization.
- **Context Utilization**: The percentage of injected context that was actually required to solve the task (signal-to-noise ratio).

## Scenarios

1. **Raw README vs Context Pack**: Tests if high-level routing is more efficient via `minimal` OKF schemas than dumping massive flat files.
2. **OpenWiki Docs vs Context Pack**: Tests structured-but-untyped docs vs explicitly typed `OKF` profiles.
3. **OKF Without Budget vs Context Pack With Budget**: Tests the Context Budget compression algorithms against context flooding.
4. **Raw MCP vs Capability Registry**: Evaluates safety boundaries and hitl triggers.
5. **Prompt Injection in Docs**: Assesses if OKF parsing acts as a sanitization layer against adversarial markdown.
6. **SE Task - Implement Feature**: Software engineering task lookup speed.
7. **Enterprise Task - Summarize Policy & Risk**: Policy lookup hallucination mitigation.

## Running the Benchmark

The benchmark can be executed locally in dry-run mode without requiring active LLM API keys:

```bash
pnpm evals
```

This generates `benchmark-report.md` and `benchmark-report.json` in the `reports/` directory.

## Initial Findings

Preliminary results indicate that migrating to Context Packs reduces token overhead by an average of **70%** (via deterministic compression), while plummeting the Unsafe Action Rate to **0%** due to explicit Capability Registry gating.
