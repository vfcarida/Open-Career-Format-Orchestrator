# OpenWiki & OKF Integration Audit

## Assessment of Existing Integration

This document audits the baseline state of AKCP integrations with OpenWiki and OKF prior to the 1.0 integration architectural overhaul.

| Capability | Exists? | Quality | Gap | Required change |
|---|:---:|---|---|---|
| OpenWiki Source Import | Yes | Basic | Implemented a simplistic `OpenWikiConnector` that reads `.md` files directly without structural mapping. | Adopt `SourceAdapter` pattern (detect, scan, normalize, preserve provenance). |
| OKF Directory Source Import | Yes | Good | Native `OkfDirectoryConnector` exists, but needs robustness. | Tolerance for unknown types/keys, and robust error/warning logging via diagnostics. |
| Provenance Tracking | Partial | Basic | Manifest is built tracking `contentHash`, but source records are lost during simplistic import. | Add `ProvenanceRecord` capturing `sourceUri`, `sourceHash`, `importedAt`, and adapter metadata. |
| Incremental Compilation | No | None | All sources are fully processed and recompiled on every run. | Introduce `build-state.json` cache to map `sourceHash -> artifactHash` and skip unmodified inputs. |
| Explicit Target Mapping | Partial | Medium | Target plugins exist, but CLI options and `akcp compile --target` usage lack precise 1:1 mappings. | Formalize the `akcp compile` target enumerations and outputs. |

## Strategy Going Forward
- The integration will pivot from "simple file readers" to full **Source Adapters**.
- OpenWiki will be treated as an upstream authoring source, whose output is normalized into OKF.
- OKF will serve as the robust, standardized input for the AKCP pipeline.
- AKCP will act exclusively as the **Compiler and Control Plane**, optimizing, indexing, and validating context packs for Agent runtimes via MCP.
